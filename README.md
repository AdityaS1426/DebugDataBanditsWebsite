# DebugDataBanditsWebsite

## IMPORTANT - PLEASE LOOK AT THIS SECTION MR. M

- Here is a [Project & README Guidance Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1w6HxfZjOa4hRD14msoQ3c4OVQyu3Votk/view?usp=sharing) to make it easier for grading.
- THE DATE THAT THIS REPO WAS CREATED IS MISLEADING. OUR TEAM STARTED THIS PROJECT WITH A DIFFERENT REPO, BUT IT GOT VERY DISORGANIZED, & WE WANTED TO RE-START WITH A FRESH SLATE, SO WE CREATED THIS ONE A BIT LATER.
- ADDITIONALLY, THE COMMITS ARE INACCURATE. AS SCRUM MASTER, ADITYA MADE THE MAJOR COMMITS TO THIS REPOSITORY, SO IT MIGHT LOOK LIKE THE OTHER TEAM MEMBERS DID NOT DO AN EQUAL PART. HOWEVER, THEY DID.

## Description

This is a Spring Boot Application Website created by the DebugDataBandits. Here, the DebugDataBandits have stored all of their work for this Trimester, including Study Journask, Previous Project Repositories, & various programs. The main theme of the website is "Gaming". Hence: 
- There's a "Gaming Controller Logo" seen on the top left of the website.
- The background image on the website includes a Rainbow Six Siege Bandit, which the "DebugDataBandits" team name originates from.
- A lot of the programs that can be accessed via this site are related to "Gaming".
- The colors used throughout the website, such as black, white, & teal give the website a Gaming vibe.

## Features of the Site

- Home Page Navigation Button
- Greeting Program
- Calculator Program
- Snake Game Program
- Tic Tac Toe Game Program
- Pair Journals
- Access to the DebugDataBandits' Previous Project Repository

## How to Run

###### 1. Website

- To access the website, click on the link provided above.
- NOTE: Our team had difficulty figuring out how to make the CSS formatting work when deployed, so the link to the website above leads to a non-CSS formatted website.
- However, to access the CSS formatting, pull this repository from the Main branch, navigate to the Index.htmml file, & click on one of the browser icons that appears when the mouse hovers over the HTML file.
- Or, watch this [demonstration video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16IfoIzSuXgeewQGXfVN5sG4CIgAeDqmg/view?usp=sharing) to look at the CSS formatting.

###### 2. Greeting
