# DebugDataBanditsWebsite

## Description

This is a Spring Boot Application Website created by the DebugDataBandits. The website's theme is "Gaming", which is why there's a "Gaming Controller Logo" seen on the top left of the website. Some of the programs that can be accessed via this site are related to Gaming as well. The background image on the website includes a Rainbow Six Siege Bandit, which the "DebugDataBandits" team name originates from. Furthermore, the colors used throughout the website, such as black, white, & teal give the website a Gaming vibe.
